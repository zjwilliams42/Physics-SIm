Physics Sim

This is a program I am throwing together as a read through "Essential University Physics 2nd ed - R. Wolfson BBS".
I am working through it, but want a way to visualize it as I go. Plus, teaching a program to do it sort of forces me to actually understand what I am doing.

The GUI is powered by MonoGame so it can be cross-platform.

Requirements:
Microsoft .NET Core SDK 2.2.402
